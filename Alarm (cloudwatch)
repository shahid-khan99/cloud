whenever we hit a threshold, we should get the notification/alarm if created

 *Cloudwatch
   Alarm
    create alarm
     select metrics (eg. EBS) = select service (eg. EC2)
      select preinstance metrics
     >static
     >greater than
              next
    in alarm
    create new sns topic/ or use existing 
                        save
