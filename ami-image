    **AMI-image**
select the instance 
 actions
  image and template
   create image
we can open new instances with this image by 2 methods 
  1) while launching instance
     my amis = select the ami
  2) Go in ami images
      select the image and launch new instance

when we need to launch many instances with common/same configurations
  we make an ami image by doing all the common configurations in the
    terminal of an instance, then we take ami image to launch other instances
      using that ami image
